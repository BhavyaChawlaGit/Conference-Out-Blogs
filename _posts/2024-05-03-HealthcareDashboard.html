<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare technology, data visualization is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and patient care. This blog outlines the development of a comprehensive healthcare dashboard that tracks patient waiting lists from 2018 to 2021, distinguishing between inpatient and outpatient data.</p>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>The aim was to build a dashboard to help healthcare professionals gain insights into patient flow and resource allocation efficiency over several years. Utilizing Power BI, I crafted visualizations that provide both operational insights and support strategic decision-making.</p>

<h2>Project Goals and Data Scope</h2>
<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Track the current status of the patient waiting list</strong>: Ensuring real-time monitoring of patient wait times.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze historical monthly trends of waiting lists</strong>: Distinguishing between inpatient and outpatient services.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct detailed specialty-level and age profile analysis</strong>: Offering deeper insights into specific service areas and patient demographics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Scope:</strong><br>
This project used data spanning from 2018 to 2021, covering various aspects of hospital patient management systems.</p>

<h2>Metrics and Views Required</h2>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Average and Median Waiting List: To measure central tendencies of waiting times across different categories.</li>
  <li>Current Total Wait List: For real-time status checks on all patients waiting for services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Views Required:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Summary Page</strong>: For high-level overviews and quick insights.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Page for Granular Analysis</strong>: For detailed explorations of data by specialists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Repository Link</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/BhavyaChawlaGit/End-to-End-Dashboard-using-PowerBI">Healthcare Dashboard Project</a></p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Requirement Gathering</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Identified stakeholders and determined business objectives.</li>
      <li>Established a clear scope including tracking patient waitlists, analyzing historical trends, and conducting specialty-level analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <!-- Other steps similarly detailed -->
</ol>

<h2>Analytical Outcomes</h2>
<p>The dashboard provided valuable insights, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trends showing the impact of seasonal variations and epidemics on patient numbers.</li>
  <li>Efficiency metrics across different hospital departments, aiding in better resource management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project not only honed my skills in using advanced BI tools but also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
