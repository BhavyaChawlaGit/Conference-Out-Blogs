<p>In today's healthcare environment, managing patient waitlists for inpatient and outpatient services is more critical than ever. Power BI has become an indispensable tool in transforming healthcare operations by providing data-driven insights. This blog explores a Power BI dashboard I developed to optimize patient waitlists, showcasing how healthcare providers can streamline operations, allocate resources effectively, and improve the quality of care.</p>

<h2>Project Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Data Gathering</li>
    <li>Data Transforming and Modelling</li>
    <li>Table Connections</li>
    <li>Layout and Designing</li>
    <li>Analysis and Visualization</li>
</ol>


<h3>Data Gathering</h3>
<p>My journey began with gathering comprehensive healthcare datasets from Kaggle, 
    which included details such as patient admission and release timestamps, ages, adult status, types of specialty visits, 
    and stay durations. Dataset categorized into two, inpatient and outpatient records 
    spanning from 2018 to 2021. This division was crucial for my subsequent analyses and honing my skills in 
    healthcare analytics using Power BI.</p>

<h3>Data Transforming and Modelling</h3>
<p>Using Power BI's simple folder connector, 
    I imported data stored in various directories. 
    In Power Query, I tackled data transformations, ensuring appropriate data types, volume checks, and 
    cleaning up redundancies. A critical step was merging the tables into 'All_data' and 
    resolving discrepancies by introducing a 'case_type' column in the outpatient table to align it with inpatient data. 
    This differentiation was vital for accurate, appended data analysis later in Power BI.</p>

<h3>Table Connections</h3>
<p>I created a specialty table to categorize patient specialties into coherent groups, 
    enhancing the dashboard's clarity. For instance, 
    I grouped Haematology under 'Blood-related' and Orthopaedics under 'Bone-related' categories. 
    These categories helped streamline the visual presentation and facilitated insightful analysis through 
    a well-connected data model in the Power BI dashboard.</p>

<h3>Layout and Designing</h3>
<p>Designing the dashboard involved strategic placement of visual elements to effectively communicate key information. 
    I started with a blueprint that included a title, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
    and visual representations like pie charts and bar graphs to depict various data points, 
    such as case type distribution and age profiles. 
    A secondary page provided detailed patient information, 
    which included multiple filters to aid in navigating the data more effectively.</p>

<h3>Background Layout</h3>
<p>To enhance my design skills, 
    I researched various dashboard designs on Google and used a color extraction tool to select an appropriate palette. 
    Using PowerPoint, I designed the background by creating shapes to designate spaces for charts and filters, 
    which I then enhanced with gradients and borders.</p>

<h3>Analysis and Visualization</h3>
<p>To kick off my analysis, I started by framing several critical questions to navigate through the data effectively:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How does this year’s total waitlist compare to last year's?</li>
    <li>What is the patient distribution across different case types?</li>
    <li>How does hospital stay duration differ among various age groups?</li>
    <li>Which are the top 5 specialties by waitlist size?</li>
    <li>What are the observed monthly trends for different case types from 2018 to 2021?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does this year’s total waitlist compare to last year's?</strong></p>

<p>For an in-depth comparison of current and previous year’s waitlists, I utilized DAX formulas to crunch the numbers and represent them effectively in our KPIs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Current Year Waitlist</strong> - DAX formula;</p>
<p>Latest Month WaitList = CALCULATE(SUM(All_Data[Total]),All_Data[Archive_Date] = MAX(All_Data[Archive_Date])) + 0</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Previous Year Waitlist</strong> - DAX formula;</p>
<p>PY Latest Month WaitList = CALCULATE(SUM(All_Data[Total]), All_Data[Archive_Date] = EDATE(MAX(All_Data[Archive_Date]),-12)) + 0</p>

<p>The escalation to over 700,000 individuals on this year’s waitlist, from last year's 640,000, highlights a significant rise in demand for healthcare services. This increase by more than 60,000 patients underscores a growing need for both inpatient and outpatient services over the period. Several dynamics such as demographic shifts, evolving healthcare requirements, extended referral durations, or policy changes could be driving these trends.</p>

<p><strong>What is the patient distribution across different case types?</strong></p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/Conference-Out-Blogs/img/posts/3_12.png"> 
<p>Regarding case types, the pie chart displays a predominant 72% of patients classified under 'outpatient', 
    which suggests a majority seek treatments not necessitating an overnight hospital stay. 
    In contrast, 'inpatient' cases make up 11%, and 'day_case' comprises 17%. 
    This distribution points to a substantial demand for efficient outpatient service management, 
    vital for accommodating the large volume of patients requiring non-admission care.</p>

<p><strong>How does hospital stay duration differ among various age groups?</strong></p>    

<p>The analysis of hospital stay durations by age group is portrayed through a stacked bar chart, 
    revealing that substantial numbers within each age bracket—0-15, 16-64, and 65+—incur hospital stays exceeding 18 months. 
    Interestingly, the 16-64 age bracket frequently experiences the longest stays, indicating a higher hospitalization rate within this demographic. 
    Recognizing these patterns is crucial for healthcare providers to adapt care specifically catered to these groups.</p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/Conference-Out-Blogs/img/posts/3_13.png"> 

<p><strong>Which are the top 5 specialties by waitlist size?</strong></p>

<p>The examination of waitlists by specialty showed a significant tilt towards pediatric services, with Pediatric Dermatology and Pediatric ENT topping the list, followed by Accident and Emergency, Pediatric Cardiology, and Pediatric Orthopedic. This trend highlights the acute need for targeted pediatric care and resources.</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/Conference-Out-Blogs/img/posts/3_14.png">

<p><strong>What are the observed monthly trends for different case types from 2018 to 2021?</strong></p>
<p>Monthly trend analysis from 2018 to 2021 shows that while day-case and inpatient numbers have remained relatively stable, outpatient cases have seen a notable increase from 0.5 million to 0.63 million. This rise can be attributed to various factors such as advancements in medical technology allowing more outpatient procedures, patient preferences for less invasive care, shifts in healthcare policies enhancing outpatient accessibility, and overall improvements in service efficiency.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through this project, I've gained profound insights into the shifts in healthcare service demands, 
    particularly the rise in outpatient care and the focus on pediatric specialties. 
    These trends are crucial for healthcare providers to understand as they strive to meet the evolving needs of their patients 
    and improve service delivery.</p>
