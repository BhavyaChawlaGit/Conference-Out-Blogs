<p>Efficient management of patient waitlists is a cornerstone in today's healthcare infrastructure. Power BI stands out as a transformative tool in healthcare operations, offering profound insights through data visualization. This article explores a Power BI dashboard specifically tailored to enhance the efficiency of patient waitlists. By leveraging this technology, healthcare professionals can streamline patient administration, better allocate resources, and ultimately improve the level of care they deliver. Discover how this innovation is reshaping the management of waitlists, and significantly boosting healthcare outcomes and patient satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Project Overview: Key Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Collection</li>
  <li>Data Transformation and Modeling</li>
  <li>Table Linking</li>
  <li>Dashboard Layout and Design</li>
  <li>Data Analysis and Visualization</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p>Data was meticulously compiled from Kaggle, featuring detailed records such as patient admissions, discharges, ages, whether they were adults, types of specialty visits (e.g., cardiology, general surgery, psychology), and stay durations. These datasets were organized into distinct tables for inpatient and outpatient services from 2018 to 2021, setting the stage for an extensive Power BI-driven analysis and enhancement in healthcare analytics proficiency.</p>

<h4>Data Transformation and Modeling</h4>
<p>Initiating with a basic folder connector in Power BI, I imported the dataset stored in the directory. Using Power Query, I standardized data types, assessed volumes, and removed duplicates for data consistency. Both tables were merged into a unified 'All_data' table, correcting inconsistencies by adding a 'case_type' column to the outpatient data, thereby aligning it with the inpatient data. This adjustment improved clarity post-merge, facilitating more effective further analysis.</p>

<h4>Table Linking</h4>
<p>A 'Mapping_Specialty' table was created to categorize various medical specialties into clear groups, such as grouping Haematology under 'Blood-related group' and Orthopaedics under 'Bones-related group'. This categorization helped simplify the dashboard interface, linking it with the 'All_data' table via the 'Speciality' column to enhance the dashboard’s analytical utility.</p>

<h4>Dashboard Layout and Design</h4>
<p>The design process involved careful planning of visual elements to ensure effective information delivery. I designed a blueprint starting with a title and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to highlight current and comparative past year waitlist data. The dashboard features a pie chart for case type distribution, an age demographic bar chart, and a top 5 specialties filter by averages and medians considering outliers. A comprehensive monthly trend from 2018 to 2021 for different case types was also integrated.</p>

<p>A secondary page enriches the dashboard by providing detailed patient data with various interactive filters, allowing for deeper data exploration. The design was initially drafted in PowerPoint after selecting a color scheme online, using shapes to outline space for charts and filters, and refining the background with gradients and borders to optimize visual appeal.</p>

<h4>Data Analysis and Visualization</h4>
<p>The analysis began by framing key questions about waitlist comparisons over years, case type distributions, stay durations by age, top waitlisted specialties, and monthly trends. These insights reveal a rising trend in outpatient visits, a focus on pediatric care in top waitlisted specialties, and stable inpatient and day-case figures. Factors influencing these trends include medical advancements, patient preferences, and policy shifts favoring outpatient care.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the analysis highlighted a shift towards more outpatient treatments and emphasized the need for focused pediatric care. The insights drawn are crucial for healthcare providers to adapt to changing demands and efficiently allocate resources.</p>
