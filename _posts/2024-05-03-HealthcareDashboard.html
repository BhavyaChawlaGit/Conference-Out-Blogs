<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare technology, data visualization is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and patient care. This blog outlines the development of a comprehensive healthcare dashboard that tracks patient waiting lists from 2018 to 2021, distinguishing between inpatient and outpatient data.</p>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>The aim was to build a dashboard to help healthcare professionals gain insights into patient flow and resource allocation efficiency over several years. Utilizing Power BI, I crafted visualizations that provide both operational insights and support strategic decision-making.</p>

<h2>Project Goals and Data Scope</h2>
<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Track the current status of the patient waiting list</strong>: Ensuring real-time monitoring of patient wait times.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze historical monthly trends of waiting lists</strong>: Distinguishing between inpatient and outpatient services.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct detailed specialty-level and age profile analysis</strong>: Offering deeper insights into specific service areas and patient demographics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Scope:</strong><br>
This project used data spanning from 2018 to 2021, covering various aspects of hospital patient management systems.</p>

<h2>Metrics and Views Required</h2>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Average and Median Waiting List: To measure central tendencies of waiting times across different categories.</li>
  <li>Current Total Wait List: For real-time status checks on all patients waiting for services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Views Required:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Summary Page</strong>: For high-level overviews and quick insights.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Page for Granular Analysis</strong>: For detailed explorations of data by specialists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Requirement Gathering</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Identified stakeholders and established primary points of contact, focusing on domain experts and leaders who will utilize the dashboard.</li>
      <li>Outlined business objectives through discussions, targeting specific goals related to patient management and operational efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Gathered data from multiple sources using Power BIâ€™s extensive connector capabilities, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.</li>
      <li>Imported data into Power BI, preparing for transformative analytics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transformation & Modelling</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power BI to ensure data quality and relevance for the dashboard.</li>
      <li>Developed models to link data effectively, using relationships to enhance data interactivity and accessibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Visualization Blueprint and Layout Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Created visual blueprints, discussing design and structure with stakeholders to finalize the dashboard layout.</li>
      <li>Implemented visual designs in Power BI, using best practices in dashboard aesthetics to enhance user engagement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add Interactivity & Navigation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporated interactive elements to allow users to explore data dynamically, enhancing user experience and engagement.</li>
      <li>Added navigational aids to facilitate easy access to both summary and detailed data views.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Publishing & Sharing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Published the completed dashboard to Power BI Services, enabling real-time data sharing and collaboration.</li>
      <li>Implemented row-level security to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
<br>
<h2>Analytical Outcomes</h2>
<p>The dashboard provided valuable insights, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trends showing the impact of seasonal variations and epidemics on patient numbers.</li>
  <li>Efficiency metrics across different hospital departments, aiding in better resource management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project not only honed my skills in using advanced BI tools but also reinforced the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. I invite fellow data enthusiasts to explore the <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/41e121f4-df11-4ab4-97a7-03be4d974620/ReportSection?bookmarkGuid=4e632310-b6c2-4574-984c-78bf0cc991a5&bookmarkUsage=1&ctid=da90653e-1e02-4208-b68a-6224891bea63&portalSessionId=dd6cbd1d-2708-4828-a9ef-3d2a09e1d10e&fromEntryPoint=export">dashboard</a> and provide feedback.</p>
