<p>Hi, I am red eared turle and I am an year old and you can tell I'll take time to grow. </p>
<p>I was found in CHInatown, CHIcago and I got a really awesome energy around me, CHI energy</p>
<p>But I am here to share my thoughts and experiences as well as my journey to grow. </p>
<h2>Let's grow together.</h2>
<p>My journey as a Chi started on August 27, 2023. I am not sure what these three random guys were upto, but I am sure I wasn't on their shopping list</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">That's baby me, being rescued! Wellll can't really say that tbh and infact I can't say anything.</span>

<p>So that's me being carried away from a shop to somewhere I wasn't sure about. And so many question I had.</p>
<ol>
<li>Will it turn out well for me? - Atleast I am alive.</li><li>Will I be fed properly and thrice a day? - Hmmm yeah these bachalors don't cook for me but got me loads of shrimps, can't complain</li><li>Will I have a better place to live? - These guys themselves dont have one so will keep this for later </li> </ol>
<p>So many questions and so many thoughts. But I am here now and I am happy. I am growing and I am happy. I am loved and I am happy. I am happy and I am happy.</p>
<br>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Well I am growing and I am happy. I am loved</p>
<p>Lol, yeah moving on - I love basking, somthing new that I discovered, always used to think why these humans lying naked on the beach and nope I have never been to a beach but I once saw my human googling about it and multiple times about the naked ones!</p>
<p>So I easily get to spend couple of hours basking, streaching my legs and ending it with sun-dried shrimps and obviously I go to sleep after that.</p>
<p>I know I know you lo-key jealous but my life was not always like this</p>
<p>Small me, small container, small hopes of surving, and just watching humans walk past, getting excited looking at me and I used to wonder whether it would be love or some marination falling over me</p>
<p>I am happy now and I am growing. I am loved and I am happy.</p>

<p>So let's grow together and see where this journey takes us.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on my journey.</p>
<p>CHI</p>
<p>Zzzz</p>
